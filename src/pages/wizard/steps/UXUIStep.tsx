Since I don't have the full content of the UXUIStep.tsx file, I can't provide the complete code with the fix integrated. The error indicates there's a type mismatch on line 587 where a boolean value is being assigned to a type that expects both a boolean and string array.

Without seeing the full file, I can only provide a general approach to fix this specific type error:

```typescript
// Instead of something like:
// setIsColorPickerOpen(true); // This would cause the error if isColorPickerOpen expects boolean & string[]

// You would need to use something like:
setIsColorPickerOpen({ value: true, selectedOptions: [] }); // Providing both the boolean and string[] parts
```

To properly fix this issue, I would need to see the full UXUIStep.tsx file to understand the context and make the appropriate changes while preserving all functionality.
